#Code for N-Body problem for planetary orbits and Burreau's three body problem done for UoN Scientific Computing

100bod.py			                generates 20 objects with random masses and positions
				                      can generate more in a longer amount of time (details in figures)
Burraus_prob.py			          Burrau's Problem code
Nbodyfigs.pdf			            Figures of interest
NbodyValid.py			            Binary star validation test (2-body problem)
